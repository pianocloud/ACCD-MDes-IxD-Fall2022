    <h1>single channel controller</h1>
    <h4>by pianocloud</h4>
    <p>Create a simple signle-channel controller that would allow you to change one parameter in a Processing program by applying a value received from ESP32 via serial communication. Experiment with the parameters you can control with the values.</p>

        <li>Worked with Maxim's example from class, but it didn't work. It took a while but finally realized I used Pose classifier instead of Image classifier which was a critical error. Lost time here.</li>

        <li>Retrained machine using Image Classifier, and everything worked.</li>

        <li>Next, I wanted to get the machine to do something when its confidence for something "Near" was 0.9 or greater. I got it to display a large green circle when something appeared "Near."</li>

        <li>After, I worked on having the audio play. I got it to sort of work. Somethign in the code made it warp. Investigating.</li>
