    <h1>find your interface</h1>
    <h4>by pianocloud</h4>
    <p>After researching additional p5js possibiitlies, I was drawn to the following: Sentiment, Text Reader, Smartphone Camera, Dispkay on screen.</p>
    <p>My proposed interface would books, and the experience would be "A [MACHINE] STORYTELLER" where the following happens:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>a person submits a story</li>
        <li>the machine displays the story as a text against a color background that gradate as the story tone shifts</li>
        <li>when done, the machine outputs a printable pdf zine</li>
    </ol>
