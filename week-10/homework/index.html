    <p>Titled "The Future Teller," my interface consists of three key experience. In the first experience, the machine is listening for a person's proximity to itself. If "Near" has a confidence of 0.9 or greater, then play the audio "Would you like me to…". The second experience, the machine listens for a verbal response from nearby person. If person says "No," then play audio "Suit yourself." If person says "Yes," then run the next experience. If person says anything else other than "No" or "Yes," play audio "A simple yes or no please." For the final experience, when a person says "Yes" to having their future told, then run a processing animation, followed by the display of a random entry from the "Future Stories" database. Machine will read the "Future Story" using Text-to-Speech.</p>
