    <p>Titled “The Future Teller,” my interface experience has three stages. In the first stage, the machine is listening for a person’s proximity to it. If “Near” has a confidence of 0.9 or greater, then the audio “Would you like me to…” would play. In the second stage, the machine listens for a verbal response from the nearby person. If the person says “No,” then the audio “Suit yourself” plays. If the person says “Yes,” then the next stage begins. If the person says anything other than “No” or “Yes,” the audio “A simple yes or no please” plays. For the final stage, when the person says “Yes” to having their future told, then the machine will play an animation. This is followed by the display of a random entry from the “Future Stories” database. The machine will read this “Future Story” using Text-to-Speech.</p>

        <li>Worked with Maxim's example from class, but it didn't work. It took a while but finally realized I used Pose classifier instead of Image classifier which was a critical error. Lost time here.</li>

        <li>Retrained machine using Image Classifier, and everything worked.</li>

        <li>Next, I wanted to get the machine to do something when its confidence for something "Near" was 0.9 or greater. I got it to display a large green circle when something appeared "Near."</li>

        <li>After, I worked on having the audio play. I got it to sort of work. Somethign in the code made it warp. Investigating.</li>
