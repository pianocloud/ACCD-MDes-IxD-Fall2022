    <h1>time & oscillation</h1>
    <h4>by pianocloud</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Wanted the canvas to be the window width and height. At the center, <em>&ldquo;pianocloud.&rdquo;</em> Added a circle. Now, how to make the circle rotate around the text?</li>

        <li>Wait, let me give the circle a dark fill. There. Ok, now really, how to make the circle rotate around the text?</li>
            <img src="img/02-dark-circle.png" alt="screenshot of canvas with a dark filled circle">
        <li>Oh, wait. Let me clean up the positions with code first. Ok… there. Now back to making the circle roate around the text? In a perfect circle?</li>

        <li>Look at that! Found p5.js code online that did the rotating thing. Dropped it in and it worked!</li>

        <li>Would be cooler if the circle was large though. There we go. How about we make the text white too? K!</li>

        <li>Last but not least: let&rsquo;s make the background switch colors on a timer. Oop, look at that. Code for it online. It uses <em>millis</em> too. Ok, I think I get how it works. Let me drop it in, and… </li>

        <li>Oh, wait! I need a second moving shape. No worries, I'll bring in our pinging circle from the other week, but make it a square instead.</li>

        <li>Hmm, looks like I have to create a second version of PosX and PosY because I already had that in my existing canvas. Ok, something like that. Might as well clean up the code so I can remember what parts go to what. And, now…</li>
